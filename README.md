# MIDI Brain
A language made by a programmer that preferes ableton as a Text Editor and NeoVim as a DAW.

## What is it? What does it do?
**MIDI Brain** or *MB* for short is an exoteric programming language based on the [brainf\*ck]() language, but that instead of being written in plain text, it's written using [MIDI]() notes

## Why???
Honestly, I don't know.

I had this idea before going to bed and it just stuck with me.

I probably saw too many brainfuck and code golf videos while making music.

## Stack

* Languages:
    * [**Golang**]()
* Packages:
    * [**Assert**]()
* Others:
    * [**Brainfuck torture test**](https://github.com/rdebath/Brainfuck)

## Folder structure
The main program is located within the root folder, but I split this project in 2 subfolders:

* **./brainfuck**: This folder handles anything that has to do with the brainf*ck language, and it technically is a standalone interpreter if you make it run as a CLI program.
* **./midi**: This folder handles everything that messes with midi.

## Contributing
I started this project less than a week after starting to learn Golang, so I probably have lots of code that does not follow best practices, or that could, and should, be written in a more elegant and performant way.

If you want to help just submit a *pull request* or an *issue* and I will see what I can do.
